# Int

**Built as a master thesis**

Int is a internship marketplace between companies and people (mainly students), built in Elixir.

The project is seperated into multiple sub-applications where each part is handling different parts.


## The idea

The idea is that a student in Sweden is having a hard time knowing what company is taking interns which is required as a course in the school type Vocational Studies.
